# VRE_Amatrice

**VRE_Amatrice** is a Virtual Research Environment (VRE) developed in Jupyter Notebook to explore the 2016â€“2017 Central Italy seismic sequence, focusing on the Amatrice case. It integrates geophysical, atmospheric, and solar datasets to support interdisciplinary research.



## Requirements

- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/)
- MATLAB with the [MATLAB kernel for Jupyter](https://github.com/Calysto/matlab_kernel)
- (Optional) Python environment via Anaconda or similar

## How to Run (*)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dedalomarchetti/VRE_Amatrice.git
   cd VRE_Amatrice
   ```

2. Start Jupyter:
